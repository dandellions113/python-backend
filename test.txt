Crude oil prices are steadily climbing. The monsoon deficit in August could impact both Kharif and Rabi crops. That needs to be assessed. However, it is heartening that rains in September have erased a portion of the rainfall deficit at the end of August,\" said the report.\"A stock market correction, in the wake of an overdue global stock market correction, is an ever-present risk. Offsetting these risks are the bright spots of corporate profitability, private sector capital formation, bank credit growth and activity in the construction sector,\" it said.The report said that India's economic outlook for FY24 remains bright and economic activity maintained its momentum. It further said that high frequency indicators suggest that the second quarter of FY24 is shaping up well too. The monsoon deficit of August has been partially plugged in September and that is good news. \"Prices of selected food items that drove the inflation rate above 7% in July are on the retreat.

For the last two years, wheat output has been lower than what the agriculture ministry had estimated, forcing the government to stop exports last year. Besides, the farm ministry has been off the mark for other crops, such as tur too, resulting in the government stepping in late to cool down prices.The issue has also been flagged during internal government meetings, where the agriculture ministry has defended its estimates.The issue came up at a meeting of the Roller Flour Millers Federation of India on Monday, with the lobby group demanding that the government \u00e2\u0080\u009crevisit\u00e2\u0080\u009d the crop estimates put out by the agriculture ministry to provide a clear picture, well in advance.Responding to this, Chopra said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith regard to the production figure, I agree that there has been some bit of a mismatch, which has been reported.

Last month, the South Asian country cut cooking gas prices for households by about 18% to rein in inflation ahead of elections.Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the plan in a speech in August to mark the country's Independence Day, but its details have not been previously reported.

The scheme proposed till 2028 is close to finalisation and will require approval of federal Cabinet,\" one government official said. The scheme could benefit 2.5 million loan applicants in low-income groups in urban areas but the quantum of subsidised credit will depend on demand for such homes, the official said. \"We are coming up with a new scheme in the coming years that will benefit those families that live in cities but are living in rented houses, or slums, or chawls and unauthorised colonies,\" Modi had said in his August speech.

However, data indicates that changing consumer preference for different financial products is the real reason for the household savings and there is no distress as is being circulated in some circles,\" it said.Net household savings declined to a 47-year low of 5.1 per cent of gross domestic product in FY23 as compared to 7.2 per cent recorded in the previous year, as per the data released by the Reserve Bank in its latest monthly bulletin.At the same time, annual financial liabilities of households rose sharply by 5.8 per cent of GDP compared with 3.8 per cent in 2021-22.Defending the position, the finance ministry said, the Stock of Household Gross Financial Assets went up by 37.6 per cent, and the Stock of Household Gross Financial Liabilities went up by 42.6 per cent between June 2020 and March 2023, no big difference between the two.\"Households added Net Financial Assets of 22.8 lakh crore in FY21, nearly 17 lakh crore in FY22 and 13.8 lakh crore in FY23. So, they added less financial assets to their portfolio than in the previous year and the year before, but it is important to note that their overall net financial assets are still growing,\" it said.They added financial assets by a lesser magnitude than in the previous years because they have now started taking loans to buy real assets such as homes, it said.\"RBI data on personal loans provides us with evidence. Personal loans given by banks have several components. Key among them are real estate loans and vehicle loans. Both are collateralised. These two constitute 62 per cent of the overall personal loans by the banking sector. The other big categories are other personal loans and credit card loans,\" it said.Pointing out that there has been a steady double-digit growth in loans for housing since May 2021, it said, \"so, financial liabilities have been incurred to buy real assets. Vehicle loans have been growing at double digits (y/y) since April 2022 and more than 20% (y/y) since September 2022. The household sector is not in distress, clearly. They are buying vehicles and homes on mortgages.\"Overall household savings (current prices) - which include , physical and jewellery - has grown at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 9.2 per cent between 2013-14 and 2021-22 (8 years) and the nominal GDP has grown at a CAGR of 9.65 per cent during the same period, it said.It further said, households added net financial assets of Rs 13.8 lakh crore in FY23 compared to nearly Rs 17 lakh crore the year before and Rs 22.8 lakh crore in FY21.The biggest item that seems to have swung it is the net flow of credit from Non-Banking Financial Corporations (NBFC) to the Household Sector, which includes unincorporated enterprises, it said.NBFC had lent nearly Rs 2,40,000 crore in FY23 as compared to Rs 21,400 crore in the previous year to the household sector, it said, adding, that is a whopping 11.2 times and that has set off alarm bells as commentators forgot that these are 'flow' numbers.Overall, NBFC retail loans outstanding were Rs 8.12 lakh crore in FY22, and it went up to Rs 10.5 lakh crore in FY23, a growth of 'only' 29.6 per cent, it said.\"The two big components in NBFC retail loans are vehicle loans and 'other retail loans'. Vehicle loan outstanding increased by about 12.5 per cent, from Rs 3.4 lakh crore in FY22 to Rs 3.82 lakh crore in FY23. Other retail loans went up from Rs 3.95 lakh crore to Rs 5.22 lakh crore. These are microfinance loans, loans to Self-Help Groups, Advances to individuals against gold and other loans,\" it said.So, it said, 36 per cent of NBFC's outstanding retail loans are for the purchase of vehicles and that is not a sign of distress on the part of households but of confidence in their future employment and income prospects.That has been amply brought out in the recent Consumer Confidence Survey of RBI, and the C-Voter Survey of Consumer Optimism conducted in July and August, respectively, it said."},{"Description":"As per the Gazette of India, the Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue, issued two notifications, amending previous taxation rates.

According to the notifications, the windfall tax on domestic crude oil production has been increased significantly, while levies on the export of aviation turbine fuel (ATF) and diesel have been reduced.A tax levied on an unforeseen or unexpectedly large profit is called windfall tax.The windfall tax on domestic crude oil production has been raised from Rs 6,700 per ton to Rs 10,000 per ton. This move aims to capture a larger portion of profits from the surging crude oil prices, providing additional revenue for the government.The windfall tax on the export of aviation turbine fuel (ATF) has been decreased from Rs 4 per liter to Rs 3.50 per liter. This reduction is expected to make Indian ATF exports more competitive in the international market.The tax on the export of diesel has been reduced from Rs 6 per liter to Rs 5.50 per liter. This adjustment is aimed at boosting the export of diesel, potentially increasing revenue from international sales.These changes come as India navigates the complexities of fluctuating global oil prices and aims to strike a balance between reaping benefits from high crude oil prices and ensuring competitiveness in the international fuel market.The notifications, No. 30/2023-Central Excise and No. 31/2023-Central Excise, issued by the Ministry of Finance, will come into effect on September 16, 2023.The government expects these tax adjustments to have a positive impact on the nation's fiscal health and its position in the global fuel market.These amendments follow a series of recent changes in the taxation structure for petroleum products and are part of the government's efforts to adapt to the evolving economic landscape and maintain stability in the energy sector."},{"Description":"finance ministry has dismissed criticism of inflated GDP figures, stating that it followed consistent practices and that international agencies have revised their forecasts upwards after seeing first-quarter data.

So, a balancing figure \u00e2\u0080\u0093 statistical discrepancy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is added to the expenditure approach estimate. These discrepancies are both positive and negative. Over time, they wash out,\" the ministry said in a long post on X.In fact, in FY23 and FY22, the \"statistical discrepancy\" was negative and in other words, growth as per the Income Approach was lower, the ministry said, adding it would have been higher than the 7.2 per cent reported for FY23 and higher than the 9.1 per cent reported for FY22, using the expenditure approach.Former Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian, in an article, argued that India's GDP is not measured from the expenditure side rather than productivity side.Even the principal opposition party Congress earlier in the day alleged that the real GDP numbers may be inflated as they do not accurately reflect the impact of inflation on GDP growth.The ministry said India consistently uses the income side approach for calculating GDP growth for various reasons. It does not switch between the two approaches depending on which one is favourable.\"As for nominal GDP growth being lower than real GDP growth, this is a new bogey being spread to discredit the GDP numbers and indicate that underlying economic activity is quite weak. Both do not stand up to scrutiny,\" the post said.Observing that India's GDP deflator is dominated by the Wholesale Price Index (WPI), the ministry post said WPI peaked in the first quarter of 2022-23 due to the oil and food price increases in the wake of the war in Ukraine and supply-side disruptions.\"Prices began to come down from August 2022 onwards. Hence, WPI is now contracting y/y. It will soon pass once the statistical base effect disappears,\" it said.If inflation was higher, critics would argue that nominal GDP growth is much higher because of inflation and that there was little underlying activity, it said, adding the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) calculates quarterly Gross Value Added (GVA) in real terms first, and then, using the deflator, nominal values are obtained.No wonder nominal growth rates have slowed, with WPI contracting in recent months and this will normalise in the coming months, it said.So, it said, arguing that nominal GDP growth is more reliable because India has issues with its calculation of GDP deflator is to invent an argument where none exists.This is just to justify the liking for nominal GDP growth because it has been moderating in recent quarters after the high growth in the first fiscal quarter of FY23, it said.In other words, it said, critics want to latch on to anything that does not paint the Indian economy in a good light.Ideally, it said, critics would have done well to look at several other growth indicators to see if other data match their conclusions.Purchasing Managers' Indices indicate that the manufacturing and services sectors are growing. Bank credit growth is in double digits. Consumption is improving, and the government has vigorously ramped up capital expenditure.\"If anything, India's growth numbers might understate the reality because manufacturing growth indicated by the Index of Industrial Production is far lower than what manufacturing companies are reporting,\" it said.Last month, India recorded GDP growth of 7.8 per cent during the April-June period of 2023-24, the highest in the past four quarters, on the back of double-digit expansion in the services sector, retaining its position as the world's fastest-growing major economy.The finance ministry said many international agencies have revised up their growth forecast for FY24 after the first quarter data for FY24 was released. They would not have done so if the underlying economic activity was weak, it said.The reaction from the ministry came hours after Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said investment and exports have also slowed dramatically, which reinforces the lived reality of the vast majority of Indians - \"that all is not well\".Ramesh shared the opinion piece by Subramanian on the current economic scenario.In a post on X, Ramesh said, \"When headline management takes precedence over serious policy making, the government starts to believe its own tall stories of exuberant growth.\" The reality is far more sobering as reasoned out clinically by the Modi government's former chief economic advisor, he said.\"The real GDP numbers may after all be inflated as it does not accurately reflect the impact of inflation on GDP growth,\" the Congress general secretary said.Earlier this month, Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran had rejected criticism of \"statistical discrepancy\" in the first quarter GDP data, saying when the same statistical authority reported the severest contraction in the first quarter of 2020, the naysayers had called it credible as it suited their narrative.\"In Q1 of 2023-24, the discrepancy of 2.8 per cent has a plus sign. This indicates that the expenditure side has explained only 97.2 per cent of the income side. It does not mean that the 2.8 per cent that has yet to be explained does not exist,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nageswaran said in an op-ed article.\"It exists and lends itself to being explained in subsequent quarters. Similarly, the preceding eight quarters have shown negative discrepancies. It means that the expenditure side has been over-explained and needs to be reconciled,\" the article co-authored by senior government economist Rajiv Mishra read.The article was written in light of debates over India's economic performance and economist Ashoka Mody, a Princeton University professor, raising concerns regarding the country's GDP growth rate for the first quarter of the financial year 2023-24.\"Indian authorities are downplaying inconvenient macroeconomic facts so that they can celebrate seemingly flattering headline figures ahead of hosting the G20 summit. But, in covering up the growing struggles faced by the vast majority of Indians, they are playing a cynical and dangerous game,\" Mody said in an article posted by Project Syndicate titled \"India's Fake Growth Story\".Mody has contended that the National Statistical Office (NSO) is utilising selective data, which, when examined more comprehensively, yields a significantly lower GDP growth rate than the 7.8 per cent announced by the government last month.

But then the government changed and the project did not progress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dadhich said while talking to ToI.He said he took up the project also with the BJP government headed by Vadsundhara Raje, but it took almost her entire stint to convince her to sanction a budget of Rs 124 crore, barely a few months before the assembly election.With the return of the Gehlot government in 2018, the project found mention in the 2019-20 budget and the Jodhpur Development Authority (JDA) worked on a fresh DPR, estimating the project cost to be Rs 460 crore. Lack of funds again stalled the project. A JDA official said that they have not been given any funds for this project since the DPR was made.

We need decent roads because all the people need to get engaged in businesses and production activities that they can take (produces) to the market. That's why roads are important for us. At the same time, the transmission line is important for us. We have good hydropower potential and we are doing good in terms of production but to get that production to market is crucial. That is where the importance of transmission lines comes and the major composition of this project is a transmission line,\" Mahat said addressing the occasion.Nepal and MCC signed the MCC Nepal Compact on September 14, 2017, for two projects, the Electricity Transmission Project and the Road Maintenance Project, which will work to increase the reliability of electricity and lower the cost of transportation in Nepal.The program is co-funded by the US Government's Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Compact grant of USD 500 million and the Government of Nepal's contribution of USD 197 million.\"We have been steadfast partners- MCC and Nepal Government, going back to the earliest days of compact development. It's really apropos that we are gathered here to turn on that five-year clock. I can say that for MCC, we are going into implementation based on that strong collaboration and preparation that we have undertaken here,\" Cameron Alford, the Vice President of Compact operations at MCC said addressing the event.The MCA- Nepal (Millennium Challenge Account-Nepal) has completed its preparatory works to reach out to the phase of former implementation of the project which has a lifespan of five years.\"This is grant based effort that focuses entirely on the improved and energized economic growth for Nepal at the time it's very critical for Nepal's economy to develop opportunities for the workforce that Nepal's young society with a brilliant future in front of it and this project is going to power that future in a powerful way,\" Dean Thompson, the US Ambassador to Nepal said.The multi-million-dollar pact was ratified by parliament on February 27, 2022 with an \"interpretative declaration\" as the public in Nepal has been driven by misinformation about the Millennium Challenge Corporation, a US Foreign Assistance Agency that aims to fight poverty, as a military pact.Despite the fact that Nepal was the first country in the region to qualify for the program and an agreement to this effect was signed in September 2017, some opposition leaders have been claiming otherwise.The US Government's MCC signed a USD 500 million compact with the Nepal government in September 2017 aimed at maintaining road quality, increasing the availability and reliability of electricity, and facilitating cross-border electricity trade between Nepal and India-helping to spur investments, accelerating economic growth, and reduce poverty.This will help support Nepal to better deliver critical services to its people, ease the movement of goods around the country, and open new opportunities for private investment-all to create sustainable development for the people of Nepal.According to MCC, strengthening the reliability of key infrastructure will put the country's economy on a firmer growth trajectory, advance stability, support regional security, and reduce poverty.An additional USD 130 million contribution from the Government of Nepal in support of the compact-the largest up-front partner country contribution in MCC's history will enable even greater impact and benefits for the Nepali people.
